- In the waypoint approach, every trajectory is first divided into a series of waypoints that the drone must attain. Each waypoint is reached, one at a time, before the next waypoint is fetched from the list. As a result, any desired trajectory must first be divided in a series of waypoints before it is fed back to the control level.
